About
=====

This folder contains examples that are build and run using PlatformIO.

It requires that PlatformIO is installed on the computer and that
~/.platformio/packages/framework-simba is a symbolic link to this
Simba repository. If not, the released version of Simba will be used
instead of the development version.
